## What should I do before I create my pull request?

- Make sure your contribution is not a duplicate.
- Make sure you have created a file named `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.md` inside of the `project_langauage` folder! Ex. Todo List - Javascript -> `javascript/TODO_LIST.md`. (Make sure the name of the file is all caps, and that the folder names are all lowercae with underscores seperating spaces)
- Make sure that if you provide a solution it is in the `project_language/project_name/` directorty, please follow the same naming guidelines for the project language directories (lowercase, use \_'s as spaces)
- Update the README to add your project.

**Please note that if all of these are not completed, you will be asked to add them yourself before the PR being merged.**

Happy coding :relaxed:
